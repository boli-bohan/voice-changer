# Voice Changer

A real-time voice changing application with push-to-talk functionality. Built with FastAPI backend and React TypeScript frontend.

## Overview

This project implements a push-to-talk voice changer where users can:

1. Press and hold a button to start recording
2. Release the button to stop recording and automatically process the audio
3. Hear the pitch-shifted version of their voice played back
